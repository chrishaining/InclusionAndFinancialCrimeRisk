# Financial Inclusion and Money Laundering Risk

This project explores the relationship between financial inclusion and money laundering risk.

## Definitions
* Financial inclusion: the extent to which a country's citizens are included in the formal economy. There are many measures of financial inclusion. For simplicity, this project uses only one measure: the percentage of a country's adult population own a bank account. 
* Money laundering risk: the risk that money laundering occurs in a country. Each country is ranked on a scale of 0-10, with a score of 0 indicating that the country has a very low money laundering risk, and 10 indicating a very high money laundering risk.

## Sources
Financial inclusion data are taken from the World Bank's [Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/global-financial-inclusion-global-findex-database)

Financial crime risk data are taken from the Basel Institute on Governance's [AML Index](https://www.baselgovernance.org/basel-aml-index/public-ranking)



##Â Hypothesis
Financial inclusion and money laundering risk are negatively correlated. That is, the more financial inclusion that a country has, the lower will be its money laundering risk.
